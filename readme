The python file Q1FCNN.py is the code containing the Fully-Connected 
Neural Network for exercise 1.b.
Please run the file by punching: "python Q1FCNN.py" in your terminal. I 
only imported numoy and sys for this file. The MNIST dataset is already 
included in the folder housed in the MNIST folder.
The best possible classification performance that the FCNN achieved was 
0.9852.

The colab notebook Q2bCNN.ipynb for exercise 2.b already shows the 
model's performance. I used  torch, torchvision,
torchvision.datasets, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy. I used colab for this 
exercise since the torch toolkit allowed me to
take advantage of GPU speedup. The best possibleclassification 
performance that my model achieved was 0.99188889.
