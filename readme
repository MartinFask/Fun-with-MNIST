The python file FCNN.py is the code containing a Fully-Connected Deep
Neural Network implementation with forward and backward passes that
uses all MNIST training data to learn a 10-class classifier.
Please run the file by punching: "python FCNN.py" in your terminal. I 
only imported numpy and sys for this file. The MNIST dataset is already 
included in the folder housed in the MNIST folder.
The best possible classification performance that the FCNN achieved was 
0.9852.

The colab notebook CNN.ipynb is the code containing a Convolutional
Neural Network implementation with forward and backward passes that
uses all MNIST training data to learn a 10-class classifier. The notebook
also shows the model's output and performance.
I used  torch, torchvision, torchvision.datasets, matplotlib.pyplot and
numpy.
I used colab for this exercise since the torch toolkit allowed me to
take advantage of GPU/TPU speedups. The best possible classification 
performance that my model achieved was 0.99188889.
